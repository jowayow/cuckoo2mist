Original description 
=====================
The Malware Instruction Set (MIST) is a representation for monitored behavior
of malicious software. The representation is optimized for effective and
efficient analysis of behavior using data mining and machine learning
techniques. It can be obtained automatically during analysis of malware with a
behavior monitoring tool or by converting existing behavior reports. The
representation is not restricted to a particular monitoring tool and thus can
also be used as a meta language to unify behavior reports of different sources.
